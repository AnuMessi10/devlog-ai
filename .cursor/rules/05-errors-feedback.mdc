# Errors, Feedback, and Resilience

- Wrap async code in try/catch. On error, return typed error objects from Model/Worker.
- Use a global **Error Boundary** with a friendly fallback; provide reset paths.
- Always show user feedback via **toast** for success/failure of user-triggered actions.
- For background fetch errors, avoid toast spam; surface inline UI states and log to console in dev.
- Never swallow errors; log with context (feature, action, IDs).
