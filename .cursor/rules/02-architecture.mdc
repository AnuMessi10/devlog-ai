# MVW Architecture & Boundaries

- **Model**: `lib/api/*`, `lib/http/*`, `lib/schemas/*`, `lib/repos/*`
    - Repositories return parsed data (zod) or typed errors; no UI, no toasts.
- **Worker**: `hooks/*`, `features/*/hooks/*`, `features/*/services/*`, `providers/*`
    - Host business logic, compose repositories, manage flows, expose typed hooks.
    - May interact with store (Zustand) but store remains state-only.
- **View**: `components/*`, `features/*/components/*`, `screens/*`
    - Consume hooks; no fetches; minimal logic. Keep presentational.
- **Store (optional)**: Zustand in `lib/store/*` — never import React components or Views here.
- Do NOT create circular deps: View -> Worker -> Model (one direction).
- New feature scaffolding:
    - `components > features > {name} > index.tsx`
    - `hooks > use{Name} > index.ts`
    - `lib > utils > {topic} > index.ts`
