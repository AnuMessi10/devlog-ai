# UI, Accessibility, Responsiveness

- Mobile-first; ensure layout breaks at sm/md/lg/xl.
- Keyboard focus order, focus-visible, and ARIA roles/states for interactive controls.
- Provide labels for inputs, associate errors from react-hook-form via `aria-describedby`.
- Use semantic HTML; buttons for actions, anchors for navigation.
