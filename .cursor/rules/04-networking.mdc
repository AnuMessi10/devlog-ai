# Networking, Data, and Utilities

- Use a single axios instance: `lib/http/client.ts`.
- Add request/response interceptors for auth token, errors, and JSON parse guard.
- All endpoints live in `lib/api/*` and call through `client`.
- Use **lodash** only as needed (prefer language features).
- Zod schemas validate:
    - Request DTOs before sending (when applicable).
    - Response payloads in repositories; never trust server shape.
- No direct axios usage in components; only in Model layer or services.
