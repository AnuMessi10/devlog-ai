# Project Overview & Non-Negotiables

- Use **MVW** architecture with strict SoC & SRP:
    - **Model (data layer):** APIs, axios client, DTOs/schemas (Zod), repositories.
    - **View (UI):** React components that **consume** hooks/contexts; no business logic.
    - **Worker (domain logic):** hooks/contexts/services containing business rules.
- Data fetching layer must **not** depend on the store. Store must **not** contain UI/business logic.
- Any async operation **must** be wrapped in try/catch with user-visible error handling (toast + safe fallback).
- Build a protected **Dashboard layout** shell early; wire auth before feature work.
- Prioritize **responsiveness** and **a11y** (ARIA, focus management, keyboard nav).

When generating or editing code, follow the files in `01-auth.mdc`, `02-architecture.mdc`, `03-conventions.mdc`, `04-networking.mdc`, `05-errors-feedback.mdc`.
